# PID Simulator

An interactive tool for visualizing and understanding PID controllers built on React, Node.js, and Matter.js. 

[PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR0hOmjaHp0) is a popular control algorithm in engineering fields such as robotics.

This project simulates the application of PID on a pendulum with a single constraint.

Play around with different gains, physical constants, and targets to visualize how the algorithm works with different inputs and disturbances.
